  description: Crafted amidst raging tempests and crashing waves, this cutlass bears
    the marks of the sea's fury. Its blade, forged in the heart of a storm, crackles
    with electrifying energy, evoking the power of thundering seas. With each swing,
    it cleaves through foes like a ship through turbulent waters, leaving chaos in
    its wake.
